    Description:
        Because file objects we open explicitly behave the same way, itâ€™s also possible to process
a given real external file on the underlying computer through the built-in  open function,
tools in the  os module, or both (some integer return values are omitted here for brevity):
"""

file = open(r'.\spam.txt', 'w')
file.write("Hello stdio file\n")
file.flush()
fd = file.fileno()
print(fd)
import os

os.write(fd, b'Hello description file\n')
file.close()
